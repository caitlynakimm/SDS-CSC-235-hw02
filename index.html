        <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis: EMS Incident Dispatch Data in New York (2025)</h1>
        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj/about_data">Link to dataset.</a> </p>
            <p>This dataset contains information about incidents reported through 911 services and stored in the EMS Computer Aided Dispatch System for New York in 2025. It serves to understand the allocation of resources and the Fire Department's response to emergencies. The dataset is provided by the Fire Department of New York City annually and was last updated October 29, 2025.</p>
        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
            <p>Each row of the dataset represents one incident created and closed in the dispatch system. It contains details such as the date the incident was created and closed, initial and final call types and severity levels, the dispatch response and travel times, and the location of the incident (by borough and districts). </p>
        <h2>Biases in the Data</h2>
            <p>Bias present in the data could come from how the EMS employees' interpreted incident calls or perceived the actual incidents. Due to the high stress work environment and personal biases towards certain demographics of people, call service workers may have underestimated incident severity levels or misclassified call types and on-scene workers may have underestimated their travel times for a better performance outlook or forgot to reassess severity levels and call types.</p>
